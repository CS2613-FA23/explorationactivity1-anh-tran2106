# Exploration Activity 1

Hello! I am Anh ðŸ‘‹

This repository is my work for the Exploration Activity #1 of CS2613 - Fall 2023 - University of New Brunswick, in which I will be doing some game development using Python.

## Overview

For this Exploration Activity, I will be diving deep into **Pyglet** - a popular Python library for game development 

Specifically, I will be recreating the classic snake game for the purpose of learning this library and its features.
