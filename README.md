# Exploration Activity 1

Hello! I am Anh üëã

This repository is my work for the Exploration Activity #1 of CS2613 - Fall 2023 - University of New Brunswick, in which I will be doing some game development using Python.

## Overview

For this Exploration Activity, I will be diving deep into **Pyglet** - a popular Python library for game development. 

Specifically, I will be recreating the classic snake game for the purpose of learning this library and its features.

This snake game demonstrates the functionality of [Pyglet](https://pyglet.org/), allowing the uses of common game development tools using Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, if you haven't already, you will need to install Python on your machine. You can find out more on how to download and install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, you are required to install the Pyglet library to run the program.

- Go to Command Prompt and enter the following:
```
py -m pip install pyglet
```
*(note that this is done on a Windows machine, machines using other OS's might use a different procedure)*

After the code is executed successfully, you are now ready to clone the repository and run the game!

## Purpose

Through this program, I am hoping to be able to recreate the fun experience of the classic 80's retro snake game with a little twist of having to avoid obsticles.

This will also help me get a little feel for creating games and help kick start my future game development projects.

## How to play

After launching the game, simply start by pressing any of the arrow keys on your keyboard to move.

Your objective is to eat as many üçé as you can and avoid collision with the obsticles and the edges of the screen. Good luck!
